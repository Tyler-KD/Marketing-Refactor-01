# Marketing Refactor 01

## Description

This Marketing Refactor 01 Webpage was created to refactor a marketing agency's existing site to make it more accessible.  I built this project to understand how to improve a website without changing what it does and meet a certain standard of accessibility.  It solves the problem of inaccessibility for those who require assistive technology to view the website.  Throughout my refactoring I learned how to remove non-semantic elements for semantic elements, consolidate and organize CSS selectors and properties to follow semantic structure, follow a logical structure of HTML elements independent of styling or positioning, fix broken links, and introduce alternative text attributes to describe image elements.

## Usage

Looking at the website, all links will work with the same intuitive display from the mock-up layout.  The HTML file contains semantic elements, thoroughly commented elements, alternative texts for images, logical structure of elements, and sequential order of heading attributes.  The CSS file contains consolidated redundancies of CSS selectors and properties to follow semantic order, and proper comments explaining the action from such CSS selectors and properties.  To see those comments on CSS selectors and properties in action, one can run DevTools by right clicking on the website, selecting inspect, and observing differences among properties with relation to child and parent elements.
